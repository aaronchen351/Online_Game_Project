# Capstone-project-Chen
Progress:
For my project i will be working on a multiplayer online connect 4 game potentially, that uses HTML/CSS and javascript for the client side of things. While on the
Server side it uses python flask and websockets, When it comes to creating the rooms, lobies, etc. Also have a database of records be stored every time a new player joins the lobby under certain pretenses, potentially using mySql, SQlite, or maybe mongodb even.
Here's the link for the milestone 1 video:

Milestone 3-3/24/23
I have currently managed to connect the lobby for a single player to the online connect 4 game. Also when they click on a tile for the board overtime, it will update over the server side on the console current. Then for milestone 4 hopefully have both players being able to connect on different computers, using flask to potentially join the connect 4 game and have some control over which piece is being placed into the connect 4 board.
